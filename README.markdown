djangolatex
===========

djangolatex is a django package that allows you to produce PDF files
using Django Templates and pdflatex.

The main entry point is `djangolatex.views.direct_to_pdf_template`,
which is like direct_to_template except that the template is processed
by pdflatex after rendering and it takes an additional `filename`
argument (to be able to set the `Content-Disposition` HTTP header).
